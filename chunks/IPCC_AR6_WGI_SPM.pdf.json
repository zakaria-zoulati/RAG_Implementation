Climate Information for Risk Assessment \nand\u00a0Regional\u00a0Adaptation\nPhysical climate information addresses how the climate system responds to the interplay between human influence, natural drivers \nand internal variability. Knowledge of the climate response and the range of possible outcomes, including low-likelihood, high \nimpact outcomes, informs climate services, the assessment of climate-related risks, and adaptation planning.
